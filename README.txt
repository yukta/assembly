Note:
1. The Event handler for each button is located right at the end of the file(as the syntax of VC++ 2008)

2. Midway functions are placed after the header declarations at the start of the code

3. The Code uses form application GUI of VC ++ 2008 Express(Book One) and not Visual Studio 2013

4. Each and every program is a part of different project since vc++ 2008 is deprecated 

5. Ques 5 and Ques 6 are highly motivated from Barry Brey Book Page No. 273-276

6. Ques 4 in linear search requires an array to be input as 23,34,56,  (ends with a comma)

7. It was not possible for coding in the main .cpp file since form applications require interaction with .NET frameworks
   which have been predefined in the header file it provides. Else an error comes up
